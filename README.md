## 📝 Abstract

Software automation has long been a central goal of software engineering, aiming to **minimize human intervention** in the development lifecycle.
Recent efforts have leveraged **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to advance software automation with notable progress. However, current AI mainly serves as an **assistant** to human developers, leaving software development still dependent on explicit human input.

This raises a fundamental question:

> *Can AI move beyond its role as an assistant to become a core component of software, enabling genuine software automation?*

To investigate this, we introduce **AI-Driven Self-Evolving Software** — a new form of software that **evolves continuously** through direct interaction with users.

We demonstrate this vision with a **lightweight prototype** built on a multi-agent architecture that:

* 🧩 Interprets user requirements autonomously
* 🖥️ Generates and validates code
* 🔄 Integrates new functionalities seamlessly

Case studies across multiple scenarios show that the prototype can **reliably construct and reuse functionality**, providing early evidence that such systems can scale to sophisticated applications — paving the way toward **truly automated software development**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Edit the `api_key` and `base_url` in the `config.json` file
2. Run the agent system:

```bash
python -m src.core.agent
```

✅ **Tip:** Make sure your Python environment is correctly set up before running the agent.
